# Et cetera

If you are visiting this page, I'll assume you pretty much everything that had to be seen or that interested you somehow in this website. This page is for stuff that I really did not wanna to keep off the website but it couldn't fit anywhere else. 

## Utilities 
So far there where just materials made by me, in this section I recommend what I think to be useful to every physics student and in a certain extent to every student. 

* [Young Researchers of Quantum Gravity](https://sites.google.com/view/yrqg/): The YRQG is definitely one of those places where you learn a lot and unfourtunately is not a well known series of seminars. YRQG consists in series of seminars made by researchers in the field of quantum gravity showing their work to other researchers in the field, you don't need to be a Phd to be part of this iniciative although if you don't have physics background at a certain level, it may be hard to follow. 

* [The Quantum Information Structure of Spacetime](https://www.qiss.fr/): For closer friends, QISS is a iniciative much similar to the YRQG, but with the aim of brigging together experimentalists, quantum information physicists and quantum gravity physicist. 

* [Prof. Henrique Fleming's website](http://www.hfleming.com) has excellent notes  concerning physics and mathematics topics (mostly in Portuguese) which I highly recommend. 
* [Prof. João C. A. Barata's website](http://denebola.if.usp.br/) is one of the biggest references when talking about mathematical physics sources, and they've helped me so many times! In particular, the comprehensive online book [*Notas para um Curso de Física-Matemática*](http://denebola.if.usp.br/~jbarata/Notas_de_aula/notas_de_aula.html).
* [Prof. David Tong's lecture notes](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html) are a series of lecture notes on advanced topics that I just knew very recently, but already got some help from it. 



## Quotations

When studying anything, one of the firsts steps that I always go for is how that subject developted throughout history, and in middle of it I was got astonished by quotations on that topic. But quotations do not got me thinking just in the realm of physics and maths, but life in general. So here you'll find quotation that marked me someway through my life, ordered according to author and if possible, date. 


* You have no idea how high I can fly.
  
  Michael G. Scott (Steve Carrell), in [*The Office*, S05E20: "New Boss"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1248741/).

* Therefore, conclusions based on the renormalization group arguments concerning the behavior of the theory summed to all orders are dangerous and must be viewed with due caution.  
  So is it with all conclusions from local relativistic field theories.
  
  James D. Bjorken and Sidney D. Drell, in *Relativistic Quantum Fields* (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1965).
* When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images and establishing mental connections. 
  
  Niels Bohr, as quoted by Werner Heisenberg in *Physics and Beyond: Encounters and Conversations* (Harper & Row, New York, 1972).

* "Have you guessed the riddle yet?" the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.  
  "No, I give it up," Alice replied. "What's the answer?"  
  "I haven't the slightest idea," said the Hatter.  
  "Nor I," said the March Hare.
  
  A piece of a conversation between Alice, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, in Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*.
* The set of transformations (50.22)–(50.24) is called the renormalization group. Rarely has there been a more pretentious name in the history of physics. It’s like calling classical dynamics “the study of the Hamiltonian group of time translations”. Nevertheless, that’s what it’s called.
 
  Sidney Coleman, in *Quantum Field Theory: Lectures of Sidney Coleman*, eds. Chen, B. G., Derbes, D., Griffiths, D., Hill, B., Sohn, R., Ting, Y.-S. (World Scientific, New Jersey, 2018).

* Toto, I have a feeling we’re not in Kansas anymore.
  
  Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), in [*The Wizard of Oz*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032138/). This is not a line from the book!
* It should be clear that there is no real content to these proofs: all one has to do to obtain a proof is keep from getting confused.
  
  Robert Geroch, in *Mathematical Physics* (University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1985).
* Because you may be smart, but I've been smart longer.
  
  Dr. Hyde, in John Green's *Looking for Alaska* (Penguin Books, New York, 2005).
* Would Ovid still had been Ovid if he had lived in America? […] So did Ovid matter because he was Ovid or because he was born in Ancient Rome?
  
  Thought by Colin Singleton, in John Green's *An Abundance of Katherines* (Penguin Books, New York, 2006).
* Sometimes it seems the universe wants to be noticed.
  
  Mr. Lancaster quoting his college math teacher, in John Green's *The Fault in Our Stars* (Penguin Books, New York, 2012).
* It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together.
  
  Obi-Wan "Ben" Kenobi (Alec Guiness) on the Force, in [Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/).

* While I was in school I hated history, but since then I have come to recognize the usefulness of quoting dead people to support my convictions.
  
  Sabine Hossenfelder, in *Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray* (Basic Books, New York, 2018).
* It's a leap of faith. That's all it is, Miles. A leap of faith. 

  Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson) to Miles, after he asks when he'll know he is ready, in [*Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/).
* One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.
  
  Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), in [*Kung Fu Panda*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441773/).
* Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery,but today is a gift. That is why it is called the _present_.
  
  Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), in [*Kung Fu Panda*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441773/).

  Prince Hamlet, in William Shakespeare's *The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark*, Act I, Scene V.
* The topic with which I regularly conclude my six-term series of lectures in Munich is the partial differential equations of physics. We do not really deal with mathematical physics, but with <em>physical mathematics</em>; not with the mathematical formulation of physical facts, but with the physical motivation of mathematical methods. The oft-mentioned "prestabilized harmony" between what is mathematically interesting and what is physically important is met at each step and lends an esthetic — I should like to say metaphysical — attraction to our subject.
  
  Arnold Sommerfeld, in *Partial Differential Equations in Physics* (Academic Press, New York, 1949).
* Stoke's theorem shares three important attributes with
many fully evolved major theorems:
   1. It is trivial.
   2. It is trivial because the terms appearing in it have been properly defined.
   3. It has significant consequences.
  
  Michael Spivak, in *Calculus on Manifolds: A Modern Approach to Classical Theorems of Advanced Calculus* (CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2018).
* Isn’t it surprising that we can do physics at all?
  
  Kurt Sundermeyer, in *Symmetries in Fundamental Physics* (Springer, Cham, 2014).
* Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. What one fool can do, another can.
  
  Silvanus P. Thompson, in *Calculus Made Easy: Being a very-simplest introduction to those beautiful methods of reckoning which are generally called by the terrifying names of the Differential Calculus and the Integral Calculus* (Macmillan, London, 1914).
* It is well known that the exercise of logic never *adds* to our knowledge: its role is to make a certain aspect of that knowledge clearer or more explicit, while keeping all the rest conveniently out of our sight.
  
  Tommaso Toffoli, in "Entropy? Honest!". *Entropy* **18**, 247 (2016). doi: [10.3390/e18070247](https://doi.org/10.3390/e18070247).
* The fundamental issue addressed by weak cosmic censorship can be expressed in graphic terms by posing the following question: Could a mad scientist—with arbitrarily large, but finite, resources—destroy the universe?
  
  Robert M. Wald, in "Weak" Cosmic Censorship. *PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association* **1992**, 181–190 (1992). doi: [10.1086/psaprocbienmeetp.1992.2.192834](https://doi.org/10.1086/psaprocbienmeetp.1992.2.192834).
* [S]emiclassically, an initial pure state will evolve to a mixed state. For reasons I have not been able to understand during the course of the past 40 years, this is widely viewed as being highly problematic. The conflict between this view and the semiclassical analysis is referred to as the *black hole information loss paradox*.

* Quantum field theory is—as its name suggests—the quantum theory of fields. "Particles" do not play any fundamental role in the formulation of quantum field theory.
  
  Robert M. Wald, in Particle and energy cost of entanglement of Hawking radiation with the final vacuum state. *Physical Review D* **100**, 065019 (2019). doi: [10.1103/PhysRevD.100.065019](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.100.065019). arXiv: [1908.06363 [gr-qc]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06363).
* The above considerations allow us to answer the following question that has been asked for many centuries: What are electricity and magnetism? *Electricity and magnetism are the phenomena arising from the electromagnetic field and its coupling to charged fields. The electromagnetic field itself is a connection on a principal fiber bundle over spacetime with structure group* U(1).
  
  Robert M. Wald, in *Advanced Classical Electromagnetism* (Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2022).

* To the wonderful teachers, students, and colleagues who have inspired and guided me over the years; and to the still unknown person(s) who will further illuminate the magic of this strange and beautiful world of ours by discovering How come the quantum? How come existence?  
  *We will first understand how simple the universe is when we recognize how strange it is.*

* It is also possible that the function is non-analytic and does not admit a perturbative expansion. But these are merely words.

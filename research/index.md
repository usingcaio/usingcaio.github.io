On this page, you can find a bit about my research interests and projects as time goes on.
This page is in construction since I'm just an undergraduate student now, so it can take some time for this page to be fully constructed. 

## General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory

My main interest throughout my career is to build a well-working knowledge of General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime so that I can work in the interface between Quantum Mechanics and Relativity, although I'm also curious about Mathematical Physics.

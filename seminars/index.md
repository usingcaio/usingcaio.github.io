# Seminars

Unlike the usual physicist esteriotype, I enjoy meeting and talking with people. I've given some seminars on many physics topics and on this page you may find more about them and have acess to the seminar's material.

## Representações, Algebras de Lie e Geradores dos Grupos de Lorentz e Poincaré

**Abstract:** Group theory and Lie algebras are advanced topics in mathematics that are behind symmetries, which are also topics of discussion in physics. In this seminar, it is discussed how and which groups, algebras and representations can be used to describe relativity, in particular, the Lorentz and Poincaré groups. 

**Date:** 11th of February, 2022.

Seminar presented as one of the tests in a Group Theory and Symmetries class in summer 2022. The seminar material can be found [here](https://usingcaio.github.io/seminars/Representações_dos_Grupo_de_Lorentz_e_Poincaré.pdf)

## Review of Black Holes in General Relativity

**Abstract:** Newton's theory of gravitation is not consistent with special relativity, since it involkes notions of instantaneous interaction of one body on another. The general theory of relativity initially, predicts the existence of black holes. Objects that were just later more precisely described by Schwarzschild, in his metric solution to Einstein' equations, which are irregular solutions, i.e, it embed a singularity. Regular solutions were later introduced by James Bardeen, by taking a mass position dependent in the metric solution. In this work, the formulation of regular solutions of general relativity are discussed.

**Date:** 17th November, 2022.

Seminar presented in the Journal Club of the Quantum Field Theory and Gravitation Group. The seminar material can be found [here](https://usingcaio.github.io/seminars/Journal_Club___17_11_22.pdf).

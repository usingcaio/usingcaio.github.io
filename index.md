Hey folks! I am Caio César, a future theoretical physicist currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at the [Federal University of Ceará](http://fisica.ufc.br/). I work as a research assistant in the Quantum Field Theory and Gravitation Group, with some big interest in the interface between Quantum Mechanics and Gravitation, as well as some Mathematical Physics.  

This is my personal/professional website. In here you will find a number of informations and documents concerning what I studied throughout my carreer in Physics, since my early days as an undergraduate student, and also links I find interesting, webpages from researchers I admire, and so on. A great deal of this website is based on my friend's website [Níckolas de Aguiar Alves](https://alves-nickolas.github.io/).

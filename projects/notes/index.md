# Notebooks

In this page you may find a list a notebooks that I have written across the years in order to learn a variety of subjects. I have wrote them because that might be useful to me when coming back to review some specific topic, but also to anyone that may have some interest in what's in bellow. Some of them can be notes from when I was taking a course on that topic and for questions of having a standard I took all the notes in English. You may find the description of each note just bellow the note's title, and each title is also a hyperlink to the pdf of that note.

## General Relativity<!--(https://alves-nickolas.github.io/pdf/Statistical_Mechanics.pdf)!-->
I've been writting these notes in order to organize my understanding on the topic of GR, since my undergrad research for now, is mainly about it. So here you'll find my notes on general relativity from my undergraduate studies about it. It is still in progress, but I might be willing to share it in advance upon request. 


## [Old Quantum Mechanics]()
I took these notes while I as taking a Modern Physics course in my 5th semester of my undergraduation. Here you may find a material containing what is sometimes called as the 'Old Quantum Mechanics', which are Black Body Radiation, The Bohr Model of The Atom and Compton Scattering. 


## [Lorentz Group From an Undergrad Student]()
These notes were taking while I as taking a Group Theory and Symmetries in Physics, and while I had to prepare myself to give a seminar on Lorentz and Poincare groups, I decided it could be usefull to put into paper some basics of what I understood at the time.

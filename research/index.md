In this page you can find a bit about my research interests and projects as time goes on.
This page is in construction since I'm just a undergraduate student by now, so it can take some time to this page to be fully constructed. 

## General Relativity 

One of the biggest open problems in Physics is the quest to obtain a quantum theory of gravity. Since the 1930's it was know that General Relativity—our best description of spacetime—and Quantum Mechanics—our best description of what the Universe's fundamental laws should look like—seem to have weird behaviors when considered together. Since then, physicists have been working trying to figure out how to fit gravity and quantum phenomena together in the same picture and at all energies.

In the late 1960's and early 1970's, a particularly interesting line of research was born: the idea of considering a classical gravitational field alongside quantum mechanical fields. In this approach, known as Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime (QFTCS), one might still not be able to unravel all of the secrets behind full Quantum Gravity, but it is possible to obtain a better understanding of how gravity and quantum phenomena interact. For example, this approach has taught us that black holes can evaporate, particles can be created by strong fields, and much more. 

Much of my interest in QFTCS lie mainly on foundational aspects. I belive an important task to be pursued is to understand what a quantum field theory _is_, especially on a non-perturbative level. I believe investigating our current understanding of the world in a deeper mathemtical level might help us understand what lies beneath it. 



My main interest in throughout my carreer is to build a well working knowledge on General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory on Curved Spacetime so that I can work on Quantum Gravity problems and the interface between Quantum Mechanics and Relativity, although I'm also curious about Mathetical Physics. c
